## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
*   npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager
*   A Firebase Account & a new Firebase Project
*   A Stripe Account

### Environment Variables

1.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
2.  Copy the contents of `.env.example` into `.env.local`.
3.  Fill in the required environment variables with your actual keys and IDs from Firebase and Stripe:
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
    *   `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` (for Admin SDK)
    *   `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` (for Admin SDK)
    *   `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` (for Admin SDK - ensure newlines `\n` are correctly formatted, often as `\\n` in .env files or directly pasted in hosting provider env vars)
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
    *   `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
    *   `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
    *   `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY` (Your Stripe Price ID for the monthly plan)
    *   `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_YEARLY` (Your Stripe Price ID for the yearly plan)
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for local development, your production URL for deployment)

### Firebase Setup

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).
2.  **Authentication:**
    *   Navigate to Authentication > Sign-in method.
    *   Enable the "Email/Password" provider.
3.  **Firestore Database:**
    *   Navigate to Firestore Database > Create database.
    *   Start in **production mode** (or test mode, but be sure to update security rules).
    *   Choose a Firestore location.
    *   **Security Rules (Important!):** Update your Firestore security rules for proper data access control. A basic set for development (allowing authenticated users to manage their own data) would be:
        ```json
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /users/{userId} {
              allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
              allow create: if request.auth != null; // Or more specific create rules
            }
            match /projects/{projectId} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
            }
            match /clients/{clientId} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
            }
            match /tasks/{taskId} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        *Refine these rules for production based on your exact needs.*
4.  **Web App Registration:**
    *   In Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è icon) > General, scroll down to "Your apps".
    *   Click the web icon (`</>`) to register a new web app.
    *   Copy the `firebaseConfig` object values into your `.env.local` file for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables.
5.  **Service Account (for Admin SDK):**
    *   In Project Settings > Service accounts.
    *   Generate a new private key (JSON file).
    *   Use the `project_id`, `client_email`, and `private_key` from this JSON file for your `FIREBASE_*` environment variables.

### Stripe Setup

1.  Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).
2.  **Products & Prices:**
    *   Create at least two Products: one for your "Pro Monthly" subscription and one for "Pro Yearly".
    *   For each Product, create a recurring Price. Note the **Price ID** (e.g., `price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`) for each. These are your `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY` and `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_YEARLY`.
3.  **API Keys:**
    *   Navigate to Developers > API keys.
    *   Copy your **Publishable key** (`pk_test_...` or `pk_live_...`) and **Secret key** (`sk_test_...` or `sk_live_...`). Add these to `.env.local`.
4.  **Webhook Endpoint:**
    *   Navigate to Developers > Webhooks.
    *   Click "Add endpoint".
    *   Endpoint URL: `[YOUR_APP_URL]/api/stripe/webhooks` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhooks` for local testing with the Stripe CLI, or your production URL).
    *   Events to listen to:
        *   `checkout.session.completed`
        *   `customer.subscription.created`
        *   `customer.subscription.updated`
        *   `customer.subscription.deleted`
    *   After creating the endpoint, reveal the **Signing secret** (`whsec_...`) and add it to `.env.local`.
5.  **Customer Portal:**
    *   Navigate to Settings > Customer portal (under Billing).
    *   Configure the portal settings as needed (e.g., allow subscription cancellation, payment method updates).

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```
2.  **Shadcn UI (if not already done by the AI):**
    *   Initialize Shadcn UI: `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
    *   Add components used: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add button card input label dropdown-menu avatar toast dialog separator sheet select popover calendar textarea badge alert-dialog`
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    # or
    # pnpm dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port). It uses Turbopack for faster development builds.
